                We're not just selling a computer, we're reigniting a revolution. The Commodore 64 defined an era of creativity, curiosity, and computing power. Now, we're dusting it off, dialing it up, and delivering it to a new generation (and longtime fans) who want the magic of retro tech in a modern world.

            <h2 class="title">Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                In 1982, the world met a machine that would change personal computing forever, The Commodore 64. Sleek, affordable, and astonishingly powerful for its time, it opened doors to digital creativity and imagination that had never been explored. Bedrooms became programming labs. Living rooms turned into arcades. The C64 didn't just enter homes, it entered hearts.
            </p>
            <p>
               Then, as time marched on and technology evolved, it was tucked away, like a beloved book placed back on the shelf. But legends don't fade. They wait. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast-forward to today, and we've brought the Commodore 64 out of retirement, not just as a tribute, but as a living legacy. We're a team of retro-tech lovers, builders, and dreamers who saw something timeless in this plastic-bodied icon. A spark. A story worth retelling.
            </p>
            <p>
               We've scoured basements, tracked down forgotten inventory, and reignited the original circuitry with care and precision. Some call it retro, but we call it rediscovery. Not just for collectors, but for anyone who believes innovation doesn't have an expiration date. 
            </p>
            <p>
               This isn't about recreating the past. It's about reviving it, so the Commodore 64 can inspire a new generation of creators, gamers, and curious minds. Because the future deserves a little vintage magic. 
            </p>

        <section class="our-promise-section">
            <h2 class="title">Our Promise</h2>
            <p>
                We believe technology is more than circuits and code, it's about connection, creativity, and culture. The Commodore 64 sparked something extraordinary in millions of minds across the globe, and we're committed to bringing that spark back to life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether you're booting up your first C64 or reliving cherished memories, we're here to make it feel fresh, fun, and authentically Commodore. Because some legends deserve not just to be remembered, but to be revived, reimagined, and reconnected to the world.
